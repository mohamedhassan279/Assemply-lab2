# Assemply-lab2
Assembly code that reverses the order of a sequence.
Assuming that the sequence is labeled as XSEQ and it consists of 10 elements. When the program is executed, the numbers are reversed in the order they were entered by the user through the keyboard. Different sections of code perform different actions which aggregate to provide the final result. Typically, if the user enters numbers such as 1, 2, â€“3, in that order, the numbers are reversed after program execution and the output could be 3, 2, 1 order.

## First Case:
XSEQ = [1, 3, 4, 6, 10, 12, 30, 31, 32, 33]

Memory before execution:

## Second Case:
XSEQ = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
